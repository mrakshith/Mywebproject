        <h2>History of Stock Markets</h2>
        <p>In 12th century France the courretiers de change were concerned with managing and regulating the debts of 
		agricultural communities on behalf of the banks. Because these men also traded with debts, they could be called the 
		first brokers. A common misbelief is that in late 13th century Bruges commodity traders gathered inside the house of a
		 man called Van der Beurze, and in 1409 they became the "Brugse Beurse", institutionalizing what had been, until then, 
		 an informal meeting, but actually, the family Van der Beurze had a building in Antwerp where those gatherings occurred;
		  the Van der Beurze had Antwerp, as most of the merchants of that period, as their primary place for trading. 
		  The idea quickly spread around Flanders and neighboring counties and "Beurzen" soon opened in Ghent and Rotterdam.

		In the middle of the 13th century, Venetian bankers began to trade in government securities. In 1351 the Venetian 
		government outlawed spreading rumors intended to lower the price of government funds. Bankers in Pisa, Verona, Genoa
		 and Florence also began trading in government securities during the 14th century. This was only possible because 
		 these were independent city states not ruled by a duke but a council of influential citizens. Italian companies were
		  also the first to issue shares. Companies in England and the Low Countries followed in the 16th century.</p>
		  <h2>Importance of stock market</h2>
		  <p>The stock market is one of the most important sources for companies to raise money. This allows businesses to be 
		  publicly traded, or raise additional financial capital for expansion by selling shares of ownership of the company 
		  in a public market. The liquidity that an exchange affords the investors gives them the ability to quickly and easily
		   sell securities. This is an attractive feature of investing in stocks, compared to other less liquid investments. 
		   Some companies actively increase liquidity by trading in their own shares.
 		History has shown that the price of shares and other assets is an important part of the dynamics of economic activity, 
 		and can influence or be an indicator of social mood. An economy where the stock market is on the rise is considered to 
 		be an up-and-coming economy. In fact, the stock market is often considered the primary indicator of a country's 		
 		economic strength and development.

		Rising share prices, for instance, tend to be associated with increased business investment and vice versa. Share 
		prices also affect the wealth of households and their consumption. Therefore, central banks tend to keep an eye on the
		 control and behavior of the stock market and, in general, on the smooth operation of financial system functions.
		  Financial stability is the raison directionx of central banks.Exchanges also act as the clearinghouse for each 
		  transaction, meaning that they collect and deliver the shares, and guarantee payment to the seller of a security. 
		  This eliminates the risk to an individual buyer or seller that the counterparty could default on the transaction.
		The smooth functioning of all these activities facilitates economic growth in that lower costs and enterprise risks 
		promote the production of goods and services as well as possibly employment. In this way the financial system is 
		assumed to contribute to increased prosperity</p>
		<h2>Behavior of the stock market</h2>
		<p>From experience it is known that investors may 'temporarily' move financial prices away from their long term 
		aggregate price 'trends'. (Positive or up trends are referred to as bull markets; negative or down trends are referred 
		to as bear markets). Over-reactions may occur so that excessive optimism (euphoria) may drive prices unduly high or
		 excessive pessimism may drive prices unduly low. Economists continue to debate whether financial markets are 
		 'generally' efficient.According to one interpretation of the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH), only changes in 
		 fundamental factors, such as the outlook for margins, profits or dividends, ought to affect share prices beyond the 
		 short term, where random 'noise' in the system may prevail. (But this largely theoretic academic viewpoint known as 
		 'hard' EMH also predicts that little or no trading take place, contrary to fact, since prices are already at 
		 or near equilibrium, having priced in all public knowledge.) The 'hard' efficient-market hypothesis is sorely tested 
		 and does not explain the cause of events such as the crash in 1987, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 
		 22.6 percent the largest-ever one-day fall in the United States. This event demonstrated that share prices can fall
		  dramatically even though, to this day, it is impossible to fix a generally agreed upon definite cause: a
		   thorough search failed to detect any 'reasonable' development that might have accounted for the crash. 
		   (But note that such events are predicted to occur strictly by chance, although very rarely.)
		    It seems also to be the case more generally that many price movements (beyond that which are predicted to 
		    occur 'randomly') are not occasioned by new information; a study of the fifty largest one-day share price 
		    movements in the United States in the post-war period seems to confirm this.</p>
